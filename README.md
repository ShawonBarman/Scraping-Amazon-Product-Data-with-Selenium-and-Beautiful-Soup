# Scraping-Amazon-Product-Data-with-Selenium-and-Beautiful-Soup
This Python script utilizes Selenium and Beautiful Soup in two parts: the first scrapes Amazon product data (title, category, price, ratings) and saves it to a CSV file, while the second refines the data by extracting additional details (description, date first available) and creates a comprehensive dataset in another CSV file.
